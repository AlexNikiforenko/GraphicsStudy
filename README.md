# A project for studying computer graphics
I am using this project to learn OpenGL and the basics of computer graphics, primarily following [Advanced C++/Graphics Tutorials](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSPw4ASQYyymu3PfG9gxywSPghnSMiOAW&si=biXji_bqeTv4vLN4) by MakingGamesWithBen. This repository will help me track changes at different stages of my learning process.

## Dependencies
I am using SDL2 and Glad in this project. The project is mainly aimed at macOS, as it is my main operating system at the moment. All dependencies except Glad are installed via homebrew. I use VS Code as a text editor and build everything with CMake.
